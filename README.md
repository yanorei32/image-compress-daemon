## Known issues

### It may not use P-core in Intel's BigLittle CPU
I cannot test or debug this problem because I haven't an Intel's BigLittle CPU.

But, this application's threads were scheduled to E-core by Windows case is reported.

If you face this problem, you can fix this problem or send me a debugging environment. XD
